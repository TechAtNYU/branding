### Branding consistency notes

- Main site and Startup Week = current brand
- DemoDays = interpretation of 2013-2014 (Emanuel/Abhinay) brand
- Ship = interpretation of 2012-2013 (Kim--) brand, adjusted with current font

#### Main Site

Repo: https://github.com/TechAtNYU/tech-nyu-site

- **Fonts**: Meta
- **Accent colors**: current
- **Initiative logos**: current (?)


#### Startup Week

Repo: https://github.com/TechAtNYU/startup-week

First marketing site with a real integration with the API. First one-off marketing site using current brand consistently.

- **Fonts**: Meta Regular, Input Compressed Mono Regular, Freight
- **Accent colors**: current Red, Orange, Blue, Yellow, Purple + grey palette
- **Initiative logos**: N/A
- **Motif**: Triangles and borders, movement/change


#### DemoDays

Repo: https://github.com/TechAtNYU/demodays

This iteration was designed around the Emanuel brand. Styling will need to be reconsidered in light of the current brand; most changes will happen in the header and type treatment. Infrastructure will be rewritten to integrate with API.

- **Fonts**: Radikal Bold + Light, licensed from MyFonts. Radikal was chosen as a web- and $-friendly substitute for/tribute to Gotham.
- **Accent colors**: Mix of current and Emanuel brand + grey palette
- **Initiative logos**: Emanuel brand
- **Motif**: Ionicons used in spirit of Emanuel brand icons. Archive has [On Kawara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Kawara) references.


### Ship

Repo: https://github.com/TechAtNYU/ship

This iteration was designed around the Kim-- brand but in light of the Emanuel brand. The main font has been modified to suit the current brand. Styling and API integration will need to be reconsidered.

- **Fonts**: Freight Sans Regular, League Gothic Italic, uppercase. Consider Input Mono Italics to replace League?
- **Accent colors**: Blue palette adapted from Kim-- brand
- **Initiative logos**: N/A
- **Motif**: Custom origami boat logo. Ships and oceans (because what is modern tech@NYU without code puns)
